We can observe that for each timer(ctimer,etimer,rtimer) the sending time for one packet is the same (1500us). The time sending for a message is 120ms approximatively so Ctimer and Etimer is good for syncronisation and more simple than Rtimer. Furthermore this time is shorter than the turn on/off radio duration. 

If we send a structure or just a char there is no influence in the sending or receiving duration>

We think that the Rtimer should be avoid because we can use only one instance at time and it will be very complicated to synchronize the network with only one timer.

Perhaps more than the timer, the more influent stuff is the radio module ?
